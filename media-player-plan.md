Here’s a plain-English, step-by-step summary you can hand off to your colleague:

---

## 1. Analysis Worker (`worker-analyze.ts`)

1. **Build a “schedule”**  
   - For each transcript utterance, capture its start time and compute a playback rate by dividing that utterance’s measured WPM by the speaker’s average WPM.

2. **Determine the “maxRate”**  
   - Find the highest rate in your schedule array.

3. **Persist for later**  
   - Store both the full schedule and the maxRate in Redis under the job’s data key.

4. **Gate client vs. server work**  
   - If maxRate is ≤ 2.5, mark the job as ready for client-side playback and return immediately.  
   - Otherwise, mark it as queued for RubberBand processing, enqueue the adjustment job on your audio-adjust queue, and return.

---

## 2. Status Endpoint (`/api/status/:id`)

1. **Read back schedule & maxRate**  
   - When someone calls your status API, pull those two values out of Redis.

2. **Include them in the JSON**  
   - If they exist, add `schedule` (an array of `{ time, rate }` entries) and `maxRate` to the response alongside your usual `status` field.

## 3. Frontend Changes (`App.tsx`)

1. **New state**  
   - Add a place to hold the schedule array and a ref for your audio player element.  
   - Also track a “download URL” for the high-quality path.

2. **Handle new statuses**  
   - When status = `READY_FOR_CLIENT_PLAYBACK`, save the returned schedule and switch the UI to your “PLAYER” view.  
   - When status = `COMPLETE`, save the output URL and switch to a “PLAYER_HQ” view.

3. **Adaptive playback logic**  
   - After you load the schedule, attach a single `timeupdate` listener to your audio element.  
   - On every tick, check whether you’ve reached the next scheduled time, and if so, update `audio.playbackRate` to that entry’s rate.

4. **UI swap-out**  
   - Replace your old progress/download components with a plain `<audio controls>` element in “PLAYER” view.  
   - In “PLAYER_HQ” view, render another `<audio>` pointing at the server-rendered file (where playback stays at 1×).

### What you get

- **Automatic per-speaker speed adjustments** on the client, up to 2.5×, with zero extra dependencies.  
- **Server-side RubberBand fallback** only when you exceed 2.5×.  
- A simple JSON contract (`schedule` + `maxRate`) driving the entire flow.

That’s it—hand this to your teammate and they’ll have everything they need to wire up adaptive playback end-to-end.
